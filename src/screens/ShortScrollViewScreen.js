${tab}Bash is the GNU Project's shellâ€”the Bourne Again SHell. This is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and the C shell (csh). It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard. It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use. In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification.

${tab}The improvements offered by Bash include:

${tab}* command-line editing;
${tab}* unlimited size command history;
${tab}* job control;
${tab}* shell functions and aliases;
${tab}* indexed arrays of unlimited size;
${tab}* integer arithmetic in any base from two to sixty-four;

${tab}Documentation for Bash is available online, as is documentation for most GNU software. You may also find information about Bash by running info bash or man bash.
